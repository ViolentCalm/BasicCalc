# PyBasicCalc
The most generic console calculator ever.

My philosophy behind making this is simple, I needed a project 
that would allow me to develop some skills programming with Python,
while at the same time creating something useful and utilitarian.

It isn't the most efficient or attractive calculator in existence,
but it has essentially no dependencies either which I like.

It likely has some bloat and things I could cut out to make it run even faster,
but at the moment it functions faster than I could even type a new number.

This project might be a good teaching tool as well for other beginners or students
learning to program or write code with Python, so I felt like its a good idea to put it on here.

Hope it can be of some use, and I might release an .exe build at some point, once I figure out
why PyInstaller is such a pain.
